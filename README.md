# House Price Prediction (Regression)

This project focuses on predicting house prices using supervised machine learning regression techniques.

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that estimates house prices based on relevant features extracted from a real-world dataset. The project covers the complete machine learning pipeline, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset (`housePrice.csv`) contains information related to house characteristics and their corresponding prices.  
It is used solely for educational and learning purposes.

## Methodology
The project follows these main steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and feature selection
3. Train-test split
4. Model training using regression algorithms
5. Model evaluation using appropriate metrics
6. Prediction and result analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
